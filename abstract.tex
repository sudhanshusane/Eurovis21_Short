Uncertain multi-variate data is produced by most scientific simulations and poses significant challenges to visualize effectively.
%
Recent advancements in multi-variate data visualization have opened new research opportunities for the visualization community.
%
In this paper, we propose and evaluate an uncertain multi-variate data visualization technique.
%
Our proposed technique, feature confidence level-sets, extends the feature level-sets visualization technique for multi-variate data.
%
To visualize uncertainty, we augment the mean zero level-set generated for a trait with semi-opaque confidence interval level-sets.
%
We find that for uncertain data, our approach provides greater insight than visualization of Euclidean distance field level-sets typically used with the zero level-set.
%
To improve performance, our technique accelerates the visualization pipeline by avoiding the computation of a Euclidean distance field. 
%
Instead, we perform fast parallel computations of multiple binary volumes that satisfy trait and confidence interval criteria, followed by direct isosurfacing of the binary volumes.
%
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique using five uncertain multi-variate data sets including analytical data, ensemble data, and real-world data with synthetic noise.
