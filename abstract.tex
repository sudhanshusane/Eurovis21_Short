Uncertain multivariate data are produced by most scientific simulations and pose significant challenges to visualize effectively.
%
Recent advancements in multivariate data visualization have opened new research opportunities for the visualization community.
%
In this paper, we propose and qualitatively evaluate an uncertain multivariate data visualization technique called \textit{feature confidence level-sets}.
%
Our technique extends the concept of confidence isosurfaces for univariate data to \textit{feature level-sets}, i.e., the generalization of isosurfaces to multivariate data.
%
Feature confidence level-sets are computed by considering the trait for a specific feature and the distribution of data at each grid point in the domain.
%
For a specific trait definition and confidence interval, we compare the use of multiple feature level-sets to a single feature level-set augmented with a feature confidence level-set.
%
Using uncertain multivariate data sets, we demonstrate the utility of the technique to visualize regions with uncertainty and the ability of the technique to provide improved visualization of feature structure. % in the domain space for a specific trait defined in attribute space.
%For multiple uncertain multivariate data sets, we demonstrate that in addition to visualizing regions of uncertainty, our approach provides improved insight of feature structure than multiple feature level-sets. 
%For multiple uncertain multivariate data sets, we demonstrate our approach provides improved insight of feature structure and regions with uncertainty than multiple feature level-sets.
%
%To visualize uncertainty, we augmented the mean zero level-set generated for a trait with semi-opaque confidence interval level-sets.
%%
%We find that for uncertain data, our approach provides greater insight than visualization of Euclidean distance field level-sets typically used with the zero level-set.
%%
%To improve performance, our technique accelerates the visualization pipeline by avoiding the computation of a Euclidean distance field. 
%%
%Instead, we perform fast parallel computations of multiple binary volumes that satisfy trait and confidence interval criteria, followed by direct isosurfacing of the binary volumes.
%%
%We demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique using five uncertain multivariate data sets including analytical data, ensemble data, and real-world data with synthetic noise.
