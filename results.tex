We demonstrate the use of feature confidence level-sets using five data sets.
%
Specifically, we consider an analytical tangle function~\cite{knoll2009fast}, an EF-5 Tornado~\cite{atmos10100578}, the ethanediol molecule~\cite{}, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden~(RSGOA) eddy ensemble~\cite{sanikommu2020impact} and Earth's mantel convection~\cite{shahnas2017mid} data.
%
We defined traits based on prior knowledge of features of interest in the data.
%
While our study demonstrates feature confidence level-sets for univariate and bivariate data, the approach can be applied to higher dimensions.
%
For this study, each attribute is represented using a $mean$ and $SD$ field. 
%
For the RSGOA data set, we computed $mean$ and $SD$ fields across ensemble members. 
%
For every other data set, we synthetically compute $SD$ at each grid point by sampling the local neighborhood.
%
For each data set, we visualized the $ZLS_{T}$ individually, and augment it with a semi-opaque, single feature level-set $FLS_{T,K}$ for some level $K$, or a feature confidence level-set $FCLS_{T,C}$ for some confidence $C$ (and level $\epsilon$).
%

For all data sets considered, as expected we found $FLS_{T,K}$ has the shortcoming of discernability.
%
The $FLS_{T,K}$ level-set typically formed a ``shell'' like structure.
%
In constrast, the shape of the $FCLS_{T,C}$ level-set corresponded to the uncertainty of the data in the spatial domain.
%
For example, for the tangle function where uncertainty is higher near the links between the blobs, comparing Figures~\ref{fig:tangle_fcls_68} and~\ref{fig:tangle_fcls_95} we found the $FCLS_{T,C}$ envelope expanded between the links in response to increasing the value of $C$, but not significantly on the exterior of the blob itself.

In comparison to $FLS_{T,K}$, for uncertain multivariate data, by leveraging the information pertaining to field distribution~($mean$, $SD$), $FCLS_{T,C}$ provided improved secondary structure visualization.
%
For example, we observed additional weaker tornado vortices in Figure~\ref{fig:tornado_fcls}, improved molecular structure information for the ethanediol covalent and non-covalent bonds in Figure~\ref{fig:ethanediol_fcls}, regions with anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies in Figure~\ref{fig:rse_fcls}, and the interaction of flow patterns in the mantel data set in Figure~\ref{fig:mantel_fcls}.
%
Importantly, for the traits selected, the secondary structures produced using $FCLS_{T,C}$ did not overlap one another.
%
In contrast, for the same traits, $FLS_{T,K}$ resulted in overlapping and occluding level-sets~(see Figure~\ref{fig:rse_fls}).
%
We provide supplementary visualizations and comparisons in the additional material.
