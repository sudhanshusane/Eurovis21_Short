Multiple data sets were chosen to demonstrate the use of feature confidence level-sets proposed in this paper.
%
We defined a trait $T$ based on a priori knowledge of features of interest in the data.
%
While our study demonstrates feature confidence level-sets for univariate and bivariate data, the approach can be applied to higher dimensions.
%
Each variable is represented using a $mean$ and $SD$ field.
%
For each data set, we visualize the $ZLS_{T}$ individually and augmented with a single feature level-set $FLS_{T,K}$ for some level $K$ or a feature confidence level-set $FCLS_{T,C}$ for some confidence $C$ (and level $\epsilon$).
