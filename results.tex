We demonstrated the use of feature confidence level-sets using five data sets.
%
Specifically, we considered an analytical tangle function~\cite{knoll2009fast}, an EF-5 Tornado~\cite{atmos10100578}, an ethanediol molecule from a chemistry simulation, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden~(RSGOA) eddy ensemble~\cite{sanikommu2020impact}, and Earth's mantel convection~\cite{shahnas2017mid} data (see additional material).
%
We defined between one to four traits per data set based on features of interest. 
%
%While our study demonstrated feature confidence level-sets for univariate and bivariate data, the approach can be applied to higher dimensions.\fix{Can we get an example in for a third?***}
%\fix{(Should we remove the part "the approach can be applied to higher dimensions" since we do not have results for n>2, but we can state the same in the future work section?)}.
%
In this study, each attribute was represented using a ${\mu}$ and ${\sigma}$ field. 
%
For the RSGOA data set, we computed ${\mu}$ and ${\sigma}$ fields using 20 ensemble members. 
%
For other data sets, we synthetically estimated ${\sigma}$ for each scalar field of the multivariate data at each grid point by sampling the local neighborhood.
%
To evaluate our technique, we visualized the $ZLS_{T}$ both in isolation and augmented with $FCLS_{T,C}$. 
%
When visualized together, the $ZLS_{T}$ is shown using an opaque level-set, and the $FCLS_{T,C}$ is shown using a level-set colored with the same hue and 25\% opacity.
%
We used VisIt~\cite{childs2012visit} to extract and render smooth level-sets using the pseudocolor plot and isosurface operator.

%also augment it with a semi-opaque, single feature level-set $FLS_{T,K}$ for some level $K$, or a feature confidence level-set $FCLS_{T,C}$ for some confidence $C$ (and level $\epsilon$).
%

%For all data sets considered, as expected we found, $FLS_{T,K}$ has the shortcoming of discernibility.
%
%The $FLS_{T,K}$ level-set typically formed a ``shell'' like structure.
%
Across all data sets, the shape of $FCLS_{T,C}$ corresponded to the uncertainty of the data in the spatial domain.
%
For example, for the analytical tangle function where uncertainty is higher near the links between the blobs for the trait specified, we found, comparing Figures~\ref{fig:tangle_fcls_68} and~\ref{fig:tangle_fcls_95}, the $FCLS_{T,C}$ envelope expanded between the links in response to increasing the value of $C$, but not significantly on the exterior of the blob surface.
%
For the Tornado data set, we specify a trait using three attributes related to vorticity, including negative pressure pertubation~(prespert) values that are associated with the updraft rotational mechanics of an evolving tornado. 
%
$FCLS_{T,C}$ visualize weaker vortices in proximity to the primary vortex in Figure~\ref{fig:tornado_fcls}.
%
Such visualizations could be useful in visualizing vortex merges during the formation of a multiple vortex tornado~\cite{atmos10100578}. 
%

For the Red Sea eddy simulation data, we visualized anticyclonic~(red isosurfaces) and cyclonic~(blue isosurfaces) eddies in Figure~\ref{fig:rse}. 
%
Using the $\mu$ field to compute $ZLS_{T}$ for the two specified traits~(Figure~\ref{fig:rse_scatterplot}) reveals regions where large eddies in the Gulf of Aden and eddy tracks in the Red Sea exist, as well as the type of eddy in Figure~\ref{fig:rse_zls}.
%
To investigate the uncertainty of outcomes across ensemble members, the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ fields are utilized to compute $FCLS_{T,C}$ for 50\% and 68\% confidence intervals.
%
Besides showing larger regions of eddys in the Gulf of Aden, $FCLS_{T,C}$ visualizes the possible existence of additional eddy tracks in the Red Sea across ensemble members for the specific trait selection, which is not seen in the $ZLS_{T}$ derived from the mean fields.
%, with increased connectivity as the confidence interval widens.
%
Figures~\ref{fig:rse_fls} and~\ref{fig:rse_fcls} are annotated to highlight one such example.
%

%
In the ethanediol data set, electron density and reduced gradient are related exponentially in regions where no chemical interactions occur~(main separating axis of the scatterplot in Figure~\ref{fig:ethanediol_scatterplot}).
%
%In Figure~\ref{fig:ethanediol_scatterplot}, the main separating axis of the scatterplot plot forms this region of no chemical interaction. 
%
Our trait selections in attribute space are off this axis and correspond to regions with significant chemical interactions.
%
%Figure~\ref{fig:ethanediol_zls} visualizes features extracted using four traits.
%
In this case, we found $FCLS_{T,C}$ of individual traits visualized the boundaries of non-chemical interactivity for each feature. 
%
Figures~\ref{fig:ethanediol_fcls_cb} and~\ref{fig:ethanediol_fcls_ncb} show $FCLS_{T,C}$ for the covalent and non-covalent bond form enclosing structures primarily around the respective features.
%
Similarly, in Figures~\ref{fig:ethanediol_fcls_oa} and~\ref{fig:ethanediol_fcls_ca}, $FCLS_{T,C}$ of each trait are observed in regions of influence of each atom, conveying the proximity of the traits in attribute space and the uncertainty in the data.
%
Figure~\ref{fig:ethanediol_fcls_oa} contains occluded $FCLS_{T_{C},C}$ on the inside of each carbon atom~(yellow). 
%For the covalent bond and non-covalent bonds T_{B}$ and $T_{C}$, we found enclosing level-sets, while for $T_{A}$ and $T_{D}$.
%
Overall, by leveraging the information pertaining to field distribution~(${\mu}$, ${\sigma}$), $FCLS_{T,C}$ provided secondary structure visualization based on uncertainty.
%
%The feature confidence level-sets for each feature
%, topological structure information for the ethanediol molecule~(Figure~\ref{fig:ethanediol}), regions with anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies across ensemble members~(Figure~\ref{fig:rse}), and the proximity as well as relationship of contrasting features in the spatial domain for the mantel data set~(Figure~\ref{fig:mantel_fcls_68_v2}).
%


%Importantly, for the traits selected, the secondary structures produced using $FCLS_{T,C}$ did not overlap one another.
%
%In contrast, for the same traits, $FLS_{T,K}$ resulted in overlapping and occluding level-sets~(see Figure~\ref{fig:rse_fls}).
%
%We provide supplementary visualizations and comparisons in the additional material.
