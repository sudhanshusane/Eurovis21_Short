In this paper, we proposed feature confidence level-sets and demonstrated their use for uncertain multivariate data sets.

There remain, however, several opportunities for future work in this direction.
%
These include evaluations of feature confidence level-sets on
parametric and non-parametric density models, application of attribute-specific confidence interval percentages, 
visualization of derived feature probability fields, and visualizations of mappings of uncertain multivariate data between the spatial domain and attribute space.
%
Further, although we considered a simplified trait definition, intuitive trait specification interfaces 
that include controls to specify confidence for higher dimensional data remain an open research challenge. 

Overall, we contributed a technique to visualize uncertain multivariate data via feature level-sets.

Our study demonstrated the ability of the approach to visualize regions of uncertainty in relation to a specific trait or feature and the improved secondary feature structure visualization that feature confidence level-sets offer.
